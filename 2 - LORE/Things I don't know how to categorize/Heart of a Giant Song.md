They say the heart of a giant’s wide,
Not made of stone, but soft inside.
Not muscle, bone, or sugared glaze,
But every gentle word you raise.


A helping hand, a seat to share,
A crust of bread, a kindly stare—
Each little gift, each softened voice,
Becomes the giant’s beating choice.


The path to joy is rarely straight,
It winds through spite and turns through hate.
But those who walk with open hands
Will find the gates of sweeter lands.


So be the one who helps, not harms,
Who lifts the weak with sugared arms.
For paradise is not so far—
It lives where kindest giants are.
