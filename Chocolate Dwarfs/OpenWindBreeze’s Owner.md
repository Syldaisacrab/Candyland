## STORY NOTES

Met in the square of Xocolatnyar.  She was trying to get her pet Lemon Liger, whom she calls Schnukums out of a tree.   The LemonLiger seems antigonistic towards her.   
According to her she has raised Schnukums since he was a small kitten and he has never known anything else.  He has been given a large yard to play in and as much cake as he can eat.

After hearing of his plight she agrees to buy him a ton of mini hotdogs for him to hunt in the yard.   After that he agrees to go with her and they leave to return to their home.
