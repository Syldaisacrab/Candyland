## STORY NOTES

We first met Dual at the trial where he was one of the jury presiding over it.

He is married to [[Sig Gharadelli]] but seems to be afraid of her.  When Sylda asks to talk to him she and the group are led into a room filled with scrying pools with a strange sigil in the middle of the room. 

Nefasi asked Dual for one of the two signatures we need to receive an audience with the king but dual doesn’t want to sign the paperwork because it would upset Sig

Dual loves fishing and owns a yacht.  He’d love to go out with [[Jodrogon]] and Blobby to [[Fondue Lake]] but needs help because his work is having a material delay.  If we check out what is causing the delays at the [[Marzipanor Mines]], He will have the time to hang out with us.    If we become best friends with him he may be willing to sign the forms despite his wife’s objections
