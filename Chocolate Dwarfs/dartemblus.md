## STORY NOTES

Dâ€™artamblus was one of the 4 deserted soldiers in charge at the bandit camp we were sent to raid by [[Commander Mocha]].   He chose to return to the city with us but quickly split to handle other matters.

Later on, [[Trashboat]]  finds him in an alley being held by a few rogues.   Though Trashboat was able to escape with his life, Dartamblus was dragged off.    
He was released from prison after the trial of Commander Mocha once it became apparent that Mocha was in fact E.C. Palmer
