our heroes made a trip to the [[Granny Smith]] and [[The Great Gingerbread Tree]] to see if any of them were the child of prophecy. Unfortunately the years of waiting and a slight licorice infection had driven the Tree mad. After 
completing the trials that [[Maddy]] never finished they earned themselves one of the 4 relics needed to open a door back to the material plane, the [[Axe of Kindness]].

Congratulations! You've reached level 4, I thought at least one of you would have died at this point.
