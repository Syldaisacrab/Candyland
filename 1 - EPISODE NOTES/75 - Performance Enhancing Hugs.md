Title: Performance Enhancing Hugs
Location [[Exoticlatte]] 

We found [[Rollo]] taste testing some things at Exoticlatte

He is not a vampire and he is also only one person.

He has been looking for the golden cocoa bean which makes a lot of cocoa???

It might be a tear of godiva

He wants us to go buy it from an auction 

He gave us 50000 gold to buy it for him.

Nefasi is pissed because Blobby and Trashboat aren’t going to the auction and has saddled us with the issue.

[[Bloberto & the Sizzlers]]

I got the bards mask and the money

Jodragon got the ranger’s mask

Nefasi got the cleric’s mask

Taco got the druid’s mask and I made a fake head to put it on

MageKnightD20#WIZard!!!

We got in with the password along with 3 others.  I asked what their password was but Nefasi yelled at me.  He said my name.  The mask means nothing.
