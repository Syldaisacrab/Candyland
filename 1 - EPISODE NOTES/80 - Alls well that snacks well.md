# NOTES

The first part of the day was spent with escaping the smugglers hideout that he was kept in, despite us already resolving the matter.  

Nefasi escapes by swimming through the docks, Jodrogan saw movement and went to go fishing for a big fish.  but Nefasi escapes that as well.
After Trashboat, Jodrogon, and Blobby begin yelling about the big, Nefasi sized fish, Nefasi (ungracefully) got out onto the dock.   Nefasi 

Nefasi has a brace on that suppresses magic, including the surrounding things.  [[T4CO]] turns back into a chest when he’s close.  Jodrogon convinces [[Captain Magnus Gumball]]to open the chains and we all went back to the hotel.

We also went to go get the signature of [[Creme Cadbury]] whose favorite [[Charlotte Truffle]] song is Bon Bon Shuffle

As we walked around town we heard a rumor that Baron Toffenton - one of the kings knights. Fought off a pack of caramel slimes to save some orphans -  has gone missing.

the password to open the lock is ‘Candy Mountain’
