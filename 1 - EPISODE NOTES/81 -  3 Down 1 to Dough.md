It’s raining??  It’s delicious. 
I borrowed 200 gold from Jodrogon to buy a jumpsuit and did a little dance for queenie

We stop in at Cherubic Chocolate Inc - Known for it’s armor

Very bright and inviting, but ultimately we got nothing

We have breakfast pastries

Edgar likes banana - for the mines

We found a dude selling a bunch of old crystals,  Nefasi bought one 

we buy Nefasi some shoes from a vendor outside the city.  it will take 3 days to reach the mines.  while on watch Jodrogan sees a small pale girl while on watch

I found a bag filled with healing potions
